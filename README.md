# Identifying-relation-between-AQI-and-weather-condistions.
This study aims to explore the potential relationship between weather conditions and air quality index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of AQI, we aim to develop a predictive model for weather conditions based on the AQI.

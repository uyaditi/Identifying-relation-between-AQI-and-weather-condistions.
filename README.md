# Identifying-relation-between-AQI-and-weather-condistions

This project aims to explore the potential relationship between weather conditions and air quality index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of AQI, we aim to develop a predictive model for weather conditions based on the AQI.

## Project Structure

- `Datasets` folder: Contains the two datasets used for this study.
- `Identifying_relation_between_AQI_(Air_Quality_Index)_and_Weather_conditions.ipynb`: Notebook containing the source code. Various visualizations and conclusions are provided to facilitate understanding.
